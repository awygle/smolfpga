# smolfpga

`smolfpga` is a development board for the Lattice ice40 LM series of FPGAs. Its primary purpose in life is to facilitate the development of support for the LM family in the [icestorm toolchain](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/).

`smolfpga` is heavily inspired by the [TinyFPGA](http://tinyfpga.com/) series of boards by Luke Valenty (@tinyfpga), and some of the footprints and schematic symbols used in this project were borrowed from the TinyFPGA B2 board under the GPLv3.

Apologies to @whitequark for borrowing the 'smol' from [smoltcp](https://github.com/m-labs/smoltcp) - I am very bad at naming things.
